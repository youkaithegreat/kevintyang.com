# Personal Website for General Assembly Web Development Flex Course 
## Personal Website
It's a personal website put together in the style of a code editor. 

Open with index.html or a live version can be found at www.kevintyang.com as of March 4th, 2021

There's a surprise with the "no code" button"

The primary files are

index.html
author.html
resume.html
backend.js
style.css

the images in assets

The other files are all carry over from font awesome, but had trouble with relative pathing without pulling it into the main code. I could have pulled Font Awesome from a server and possibly even prismjs, but wanted it specifically to be able to run from a zip file. 

### Dependencies
* HTML/CSS/JS 
* Font Awesome and it's library for icons
* Prism for the code editor layout
* Also used a website to auto demark code for Prism
